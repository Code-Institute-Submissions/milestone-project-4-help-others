# Help others

## Table of Contents

## 1. Demo

Check out the deployed website [here](https://help-others.herokuapp.com/).

## 2. UX

To create a sleek look and a homogeneous experience for the user I used the colors grey, white and black consistently throughout the project.

In order to create an easy and intuitive user experience I designed the website in a way where it is simple for the user to use.

### Target Audience

The website targets anyone who is interested in donating to a good cause. Projects supporting education, housing, health care and many more are availabe. User can browse through the website and read about the different projects before selecting them and paying via credit card. Additionally this website offers the possibility for users to add their own donation projects, so that other users can see them and make a donation.

### User Stories

As a user I expect/would like/need:

1. to create an account in order to select projects and make a donation.

2. to delete my account if I don't see the need in having it anymore.

3. to change my password.

4. to view existing projects in order to find some that I decide to donate to.

5. to have the projects sorted in different categories in order to look for projects that are supporting a specific cause.

6. to add projects in order to share them with others and enable them to donate money.

7. to edit the projects that I have added.

8. to delete the projects that I have added.

9. that no other user is able to edit and delete the projects that I added.

10. to have a profile page where I can see my user details and all the projects that I have added.

11. to select how much I want to donate for a project and add it to a shopping cart.

12. to be able to view the selection that I have added to the cart and amend the amount I want to donate.

13. to donate money to the selected projects via a credit card.

### Wireframes

#### Page Structure

- **Navbar:** Using Bootstrap, the navbar is fixed at the top and collapses on medium and small devices. It is then accessible through a button that enables a dropdown menu. On the left side the navbar contains the website's name and the links to 'Home', 'Projects' and 'Categories', which opens a dropdown menu with the different project categories. These links on the left side are always visible. If the user is logged in the the right side of the navbar contains a personalized link to the user's profile page, 'Logout', 'Cart' and a number that will display the amount of projects that have already been added to the cart. If the user is not logged in, the right side of the navbar will only display 'Register' and 'Login' buttons.
